# Target-Tracking-with-Pan-Tilt

Our aim is to model and control an acquisition and tracking system of a target. This system is built on top of a mobile robot "Rasteirinho" and will track the target using a combination of horizontal and vertical movement (Pan-Tilt). These movements are executed with the help of two servomotor through the acquisition of data from an end-effector camera. The main purpose of the proposed system is to keep the camera fixed on the target's centroid.
